# BarFinder
iOS Objective-C app that shows curated bars in your area - First iOS app I ever made! :)


You can view demonstration of iOS App here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChHEXJNQDdM

HOW TO USE:
- Be sure to download and install CocoaPods as that’s how you install the Google Maps API and will be useful if you plan to tinker around with the app.

- To open this project properly, open “Bar finder.xcworkspace” as it’s a file created by Cocoa pods. 

- Be sure to make a Google API Key for Google Maps that matches the identifier your going to user. Input the key in the AppDelegate.m file otherwise map won’t work.


Have fun with the app guys. It’s nothing ground breaking but it was my first iOS app I ever built as my final project for CS50 which I took through extension school so have fun in good health.

Documentation & Design PDF’s are just addendum’s which were submitted with the app to explain to my TF how the app functions. If you have two minutes to spare, it’s definitely worth a quick read.
